JSS Recipes
===============================

These recipes are intended to be used with my [jss-autopkg-addon](https://github.com/sheagcraig/jss-autopkg-addon).

The "non-autopkg" directory is for packages which I have made for various Mac App Store apps I want to redeploy, and have packaged with a packaging tool outside of autopkg. I wrote a quick "repackage.py" script to do this, although the outcome is not dependent on the tool used.

### Note:

These recipes specify self service icons, which are not included in the repository for copyright reasons. If you want to use them, you will have to go and grab them all. If you don't want to go to the trouble (understandable!), you can override the icon settings, or just make copies of these recipes and edit to your liking. Unlike regular AutoPkg recipes, these really are more about distribution than configuring package creation, and as such, won't really change (except as JSSImporter changes).
