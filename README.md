JSS Recipes
===============================

These recipes are intended to be used with the addon to autopkg "jss-autopkg-addon". Specifically, they need to use my fork of it. Also, as I have a pretty different development branch going, as I merge that back into my master, these recipes will diverge further from Allister's version.

The "non-autopkg" directory is for packages which I have made for various Mac App Store apps I want to redeploy, and have packaged with a packaging tool outside of autopkg. I wrote a quick "repackage.py" script to do this, although the outcome is not dependent on the tool used.
