This recipe adds an extension attribute to the JSS which checks for whether any of the major office apps are not current AND whether the prerequisite of version 14.1.0 is met.

It then scopes to a smart group based on this extension attribute.

If you need finer-grained control of version-checking take a look at the extension attribute file included.
